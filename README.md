# 🧮 Operational Research Cost Minimization Model

A web-based decision support system designed to **minimize total operational costs** in waste collection, processing, and disposal systems using principles from **Operational Research (OR)**.

This project was developed as part of the **Operational Research Course Project** at **VIT Vellore**.
